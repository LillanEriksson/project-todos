# Project Todos

This is a todo-app built with React and Redux f√∂r statemanagement.

## The problem

I started with sketching out on paper the components I needed, and then creating them in code. I focused at first of the functionality, then I used styled components for the appearance.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
